                <p>Inspiration; it isn't something that can only be found in the moments that make you feel like you're having an
                existential crisis. Maybe you see someone having the job that you want, or maybe you see someone working out and it
                reminds you of your new year's resolutions. You get a new fire burning inside of you that wants to make a change, but
                after a few days or weeks it starts to burn out again.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>These types of occurrences aren't necessarily a bad thing. As a matter of fact, they mostly inspire you to make a
                positive change. It is however hardly something you would call sustainable. What if I told you that these big bursts of
                inspiration you've experienced before can be found in the simple things, like walking your dog, or by staring out of
                your window?</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Inspiration is not that hard to come by in your day to day life. It is everywhere around you. From the air that you
                breathe, to the little piece of greenery that you can see outside of your window. However, you might wonder: “Why should
                this be inspiring?” The answer to your question is relatively simple: by grounding yourself. To just be for a second
                and to really see the world around you. To take notice of the air filling your lungs, to feel the sensation of a soft
                fabric on your skin, we are all part of a bigger picture.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>By realising that you are part of a bigger picture, that everything around you is alive, you can feel more at ease with
                just being alive too. Why would someone working out or having the job that you want be any more inspiring than a
                steadfast tree standing its ground? Or a diligent bee, tirelessly working to safeguard an entire ecosystem? Being
                yourself and being in the moment will help you access your uncapped creative potential without any boundaries set on it
                by the troubles of modern life.</p>
